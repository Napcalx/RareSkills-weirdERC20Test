# Issues in the Contract

## 1. No Logging on Freeze/Unfreeze Actions
There are no events emitted when accounts are frozen or unfrozen, making it harder to track or audit such actions.

## 2. Frozen Accounts Can Still Burn Tokens
The `burn` function does not check the `isFrozen` mapping, allowing frozen accounts to still burn their tokens.

## 3. Bypass via Proxies or `delegatecall`
If another contract uses `delegatecall` to interact with this contract, it may bypass the `isFrozen` check by altering the `msg.sender`.

## 4. Insufficient `transferFrom` Check
The `transferFrom` function only checks `msg.sender`, but not the `from` account. A frozen `from` account can still have tokens transferred on their behalf.
